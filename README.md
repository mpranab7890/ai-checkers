# AI-Checkers

This is an implementation of Checkers game using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript with an AI built using minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning. 

## Game modes

### Play Vs Computer

The game can be played with an AI which further consists of three different modes :
#### Easy Medium Hard

The game modes have the complexity as the name suggests. 

### Play Vs User
In this mode, both players are the users.


## Basic Instructions
To move a piece, just click a piece and if there are available moves for that piece, the destination blocks corresponding to the moves are highlighted. The user can then move the piece to the destination block by simply clicking the destination block.
The rules of the game are given in the Instructions section of the game itself which can be accessed from the main menu.

## Move Recommendations
If you're confused about the next move, just click the checkbox next to "Recommend move" in the main game. It will suggest you some great moves. The moves aren't generated randomly. They are also created with the help of AI and provides a decent suggestion.
